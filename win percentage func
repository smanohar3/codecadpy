/*
Create a function called win_percentage() that takes two parameters named wins and losses.

This function should return out the total percentage of games won by a team based on these two numbers.
*/

# Write your win_percentage function here:
def win_percentage(wins,losses):
  total = wins + losses
  win_per = (wins/total)*100
  return win_per

# Uncomment these function calls to test your win_percentage function:
print(win_percentage(5, 5))
# should print 50
print(win_percentage(10, 0))
# should print 100
