/*
Create a function named lots_of_math(). This function should have four parameters named a, b, c, and d. The function should print 3 lines and return 1 value.

First, print the sum of a and b.

Second, print d subtracted from c.

Third, print the first number printed, multiplied by the second number printed.

Finally, return the third number printed mod a.
*/

# Write your lots_of_math function here:
def lots_of_math(a,b,c,d):
  sum_num = a + b
  sub_num = d - c
  third_num = sum_num * sub_num
  mod_third_num = third_num % a
  return mod_third_num


# Uncomment these function calls to test your lots_of_math function:
print(lots_of_math(1, 2, 3, 4))
# should print 3, -1, -3, 0
print(lots_of_math(1, 1, 1, 1))
# should print 2, 0, 0, 0
